Part initiation, part hazing, and part performance art, Neptune Day traditionally started with a royal processional led by King Neptune and his court. Pollywogs, those crossing the equator for the first time, were then initiated into the Order of Shellbacks through a series of humiliating and often dangerous rites, including the shaving of heads. Even Charles Darwin wasn\u2019t spared on the HMS Beagle. As he wrote in his diary, \u201cWe have crossed the Equator, & I have undergone the disagreeable operation of being shaved.\u201d\n\nSemester at Sea keeps this maritime tradition alive, toning down the hazing\u2014these are college students, not seasoned sailors. For hours, a procession of pollywogs moved through the same ritual: getting slimed, cleansing with saltwater, kissing the fish, kissing the ring, pledging fealty, and being declared a shellback. The final step\u2014head shaving\u2014is optional.\nWhy travelers book it\n\t\u2022\tThere is not a lot to do on a ship at sea for 10 days in the doldrums\n\t\u2022\tPeer pressure\n\t\u2022\tTo participate in an honorable nautical tradition\n\t\u2022\tAn excuse to party in a bikini\nGood to know\n\t\u2022\tThe dead fish decays as the day goes on\n\t\u2022\tClose your eyes and shut your mouth before a foaming pitcher of ice cold green slime is poured over your head.\n\t\u2022\tShikara\u2019s hit song \u201cWaka Waka (This time for Africa) is the traditional song for SAS\u2019s Neptune Day ceremonies\n\t\u2022\tIf you get your head shaved, you can choose buzz cut instead of a clean shave (bowling ball).\n\nWhat\u2019s included\n\t\u2022\tGreen slime\n\t\u2022\tSaltwater swimming pool\n\t\u2022\tDead fish\n\t\u2022\tRoyal court, including King Neptune \n\t\u2022\tTrained barber with electric shaver\n\nNot included\n\t\u2022\tBaseball cap to cover your head for the next weeks or months\n\t\u2022\tPhoto to send to your mother\n\t\u2022\tShampoo to wash out the slime\n\t\u2022\tYour dignity\n\n4.8 (3,028 reviews)   Have chat divide it\nMargo W   3 stars\nNot my thing\nI was already a shellback.

Les Nomades unfolds a tale of heritage and craftsmanship inspired by the nomadic spirit of the region. Our rugs, especially those crafted by the Berbers in the Atlas Mountains, embody centuries of cultural exchange along ancient trade routes. Our rugs are a celebration of enduring artistry and the vibrant tapestry woven by diverse influences. Today, they travel from the villages of the Atlas Mountains to our Marrakech showroom and, finally, directly to your doorstep. \nWhy travelers shop there\n\t\u2022\tThey get lost in the Marrakech Medina and wander in.\n\t\u2022\tTheir research on buying rugs in Marrakech sends them to Les Nomades.\n\t\u2022\tTheir tour guide brings them.\n\t\u2022\tWhen you buy a Moroccan rug in Morocco, every time you see it in your home, you will smile and remember wandering lost in the Marrakech Medina and riding a camel in the Sahara. \n\nGood to know\n\t\u2022\tWalk-ins welcome, scheduling a visit ensures a tailored personal experience.\n\t\u2022\tThe tea, cookies, and lessons in history, culture, and rug weaving are free.\n\t\u2022\tNegotiate, it\u2019s expected, and can be fun if done in the right spirit.\n\t\u2022\tEvery rug tells a story.\n\t\u2022\tLes Nomades has over 28,000 rugs.\nDetails\nMeeting Point Bennahid #40 Derb Zaouiat Lhadar, Marrakesh 40030, open every day from 9:00 am to 7:00 pm, even during Ramadan\nEnding Point  Your purchase will be shipped to your home via DHL Express.\n\nAccessibility   Cushioned benches and chairs and piles of rugs available for sitting; salesman will bring everything to you\nWhat to bring    Dimensions and photos of the room(s) where you envision putting a Moroccan rug\nReviews\n4.8 stars (642 reviews)\nOn the reviews, tell Chat to make the math work with only 5 star and one star reviews\n\nMargo W April 2024 5 star \nMarrakech in my family room\nWow, I told the salesperson the size, color, style, and price I wanted. He returned with three rugs of the 28,000 in the store. All three fit the criteria. I wanted to buy two. I bought one. When I walk on it, it brings me back to Marrakech. \nRegina G five star\nHave Tea\nI didn\u2019t buy a rug, I have carpeting at home, but loved the hospitality. The way they pour the tea from several feet above the cup, amazing. After being lost in the Medina, it was nice to sit and relax.\n\nChad 1 star\nScam\nThe salesmen are inefficient. I didn\u2019t want a history lesson and don\u2019t care about the villagers who supposedly wove the rug by hand. I just wanted to know the price. I\u2019m sure the tour guide would have gotten a big kickback if I bought anything. I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t tip the guide either. I\u2019ll find something on eBay when I get home."

To participate, the girl must be a virgin. As part of the ceremony, the young girl sits on a sacred stone. If she is not a virgin, legend has it, she\u2019ll get stuck. \n\nSupporters of the ceremony describe Dipo as a rite of passage that teaches girls about domestic life, sexual health, and marriage. Critics point to its rigid gender roles and fixation on virginity. Recently, this has become a practical problem. As one local newspaper headline bluntly put it: \u201cLack of virgins frustrates Dipo rites.\u201d Two workarounds have emerged: allowing younger girls, some as young as four, and allowing sexually active girls who have not given birth.\n\nPrior to the Dipo Festival, usually held in April, the girls practice, and you can attend a practice. \n\nWhy travelers book it\n\t\u2022\tThey want an authentic cultural experience.\n\t\u2022\tThe Akwasidae Festival in Kumasi takes place only once every six weeks and does not align with their travel dates.\n\t\u2022\tThe animal safari options in Ghana are not as strong as those in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Botswana, and most other African countries.\n\t\u2022\tGhana is a relatively stable democracy, but short on tourist infrastructure and activities.\n\nGood to know\n\t\u2022\tThe performance will be totally fake, staged just for you.\n\t\u2022\tYou may meet Ms. Black USA at the recycled glass bead workshop, and your guide will convince her to join you at the staged ceremony.\n\t\u2022\tThe girls will wear exquisite recycled-glass beaded necklaces.\n\t\u2022\tThe necklaces are heavy, which you will experience when you join in their dance.\n\t\u2022\tTaking and giving away photos with an instant camera will increase your popularity, but not as much as being Ms. Black USA.\nWhat\u2019s Included\n\t\u2022\tThree outfitted dancers, musicians, a singer, a sound system, tent and decorations, plastic chairs, and attendance by the village\n\t\u2022\tVideo footage of you joining the girls in their dance\n\t\u2022\tSwig of unknown liquor from an unlabeled bottle shared by the village chief\n\t\u2022\tKnowledge you made a sizeable financial contribution to the village\n\nNot included\n\t\u2022\tExplanation of the meaning of the many beaded necklaces\n\t\u2022\tExplanation of the meaning of the markings on the girls\u2019 arms, backs, and chest\n\t\u2022\tExplanation of the dance\n\t\u2022\tExplanation of the Dipo ceremony\n\nDetails\nMeeting Point  Odumase Krobo, Ghana, whenever you arrive it starts\nEnding Point    Ends whenever you are done\nAccessibility     Ability to join in the dancing is appreciated, but not required\nWhat to bring    Instant camera, the physical photos will be a hit\n\nReviews\n3.5 stars (1)   Only line is 3.5 stars\nMargo W March 2024\nAuthentically Fake\nI felt pressured to take a swig out of that bottle.
